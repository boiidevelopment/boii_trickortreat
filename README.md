# BOII | Development - Seasonal: Halloween Trick or Treat

Happy Halloween!

Here we have a simple but fun trick or treat script for your citizens to enjoy.
This resource offers players a unique in-game experience, bringing the festivity of Halloween right into the heart of your roleplay environment.
When players speak to a local they can be given either a trick or a treat, randomly selected. 
Script includes 6 tricks and 6 treats, but is set up to be infinitely expandable if you want to add anything extra.
Enjoy!

### Dependencies
